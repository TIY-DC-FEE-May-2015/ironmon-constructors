## Ironmon!

A simple menu-based fighting game built with object-oriented JavaScript

### Description

Ironmon allows you to pit two characters against one another in menu-driven combat. Choose from water, fire, grass or no character class, and enjoy a range of options spanning attack, train, and heal. This project grew from an assignment to create various object classes to pass basic gameplay tests. I then integrated the pieces into a functioning combat platform. Although barebones it can provide the model for basic combat to integrate into a more sophisticated game.

### Instructions

The game requires two players, preferably with different names. (If you repeat the same name, the game will know!)

Classes mimic a rock, paper, scissors cycle of advantage. Fire > Grass > Water > Fire. No Class confers no bonus or penalty.

Attack generates a random number based on power level. Training increases your power multiplier. Healing currently only revives a set range of HP so it pays to defeat your rival before they train too far.

Victors will have their exploits recorded in legend as long as the client-side memory is active.

### Plans

This was very fun to work on as a personal project, and I want to get back to it. Next steps will include reducing class and power bonuses. I intend to develop variety to make the gameplay a bit more engaging - class-specific attacks and a speed factor are in mind.
